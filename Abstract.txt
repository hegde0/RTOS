This example program shows how to use the RTX Kernel mailboxes
for task inter-communication. Because the message objects in this
example are fixed size, the RTX Thread-Safe Fixed-Block Memory
Allocation functions are used. They are fully reentrant and can
be used with RTX Kernel with no restrictions.

LED's will be turned on at each stage in addition to message being sent onto the serial console
